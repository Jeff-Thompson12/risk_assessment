# Overview

The `renv` package provides project-local R dependency management to your projects.  
It helps manage library paths (and other project-specific state) to help isolate your projectâ€™s R dependencies.  
The `renv` package helps you create **r**eproducible **env**ironments for your R projects.  
It will make your R packages more **isolated**, **portable** and **reproducable**.

## How to use it

First one has to initialize a new project-local environment with a private R library - which can be done via `renv::init()`.
Afterwards, work in the project as usual and save the current state of the project library with `renv::snapshot()`.
This result will be saved into a lockfile - named `renv.lock`.
Now, continue working on your project and call `renv::snapshot()` again, in order to update the project state - or with `renv::restore()`, revert the previous state if you have encountered problems while developing.

## How to ignore files in the lock file

By default `renv` ignores all files stated in the `.gitignore` file. If you want to extend that further, you can use a `.renvignore` file - which is specified similar to the `.gitignore` file.
The `lockfile` will only be upgraded in case of need for very important features as the development team wants to keep a stable version at any given time.
