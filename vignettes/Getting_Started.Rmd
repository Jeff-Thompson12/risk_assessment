## Introduction

This guide will help you get started.

We are assuming you are starting with an empty database and and empty credentials file.

## First-time login

After you have instaled the riskmetric package, open it and run:
  
riskassessment::run_app()

The initial login page appears with the note on the bottom:</br>
Note to login for the first time, use the admin userid ADMIN with password QWERTY1.

<left>

**This is a first-time use only.**

Once you login, the app will ask you to change your password, then ask you to login again.</br>
So change your password and click on "update new password" and then click "login"

</br>

## Subsequent logins

Now when you use `run_app()`
the login note disappears.

Or you can use `run_app(pre_auth_user = TRUE)`
which will skip the login page and take you to the main panel.

Now select the help button in the upper right-hand corner, and let it walk you through the “widgets” defined on the page.

## Upload a package

The next thing you will need to do is upload some packages to review.

You can do this either manually or select a .csv file you have created.
The .csv file requires two columns: “package” and “version.”
But since the “riskassessment” app always selects the latest version,
you can set version to “0.0.0” for all of your packages.

Here, we are going to type in “glue” in the “Manual Input” text box  and select the red “next” button


![](images/sel_package.png){width=882px height=414px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}
You will see a progress display like this one:

![](images/progress_modal.png){width=382px height=157px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}


And then it will show you a “Summary of Uploaded Packages”

## Sidebar 

Now go to the “package control panel” on the left side and select a package.
Note that when you do this, the version and STATUS and RISK boxes are populated,
And the “Select Overall Risk” slider, and the “Submit Decision” and “Submit Overall Comment” buttons become available to you.

## Other main-panel tabs

The “Maintenance Metrics”, “Community Usage Metrics” and “Report Preview” are now available and populated.   Comments can be added at the bottom of the “Maintenance Metrics” panel as well as the “Community Usage Metrics” panel.

Here is a look at the Maintenance Metrics for the "glue" package:

![](images/maint_metric2.png){width=600px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}
The report can be downloaded as either an .html, a .docx, or a .pdf file.

![](images/community_usage1.png){width=600px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}
![](images/community_usage2.png){width=600px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}
## More tabs

In the upper left, above “R PACKAGE RISK ASSESSMENT APP” are four tabs.

You are currently in the first tab, “Risk Assessment.”

The second tab, “database” shows, for each package loaded, the package name and version, it’s riskassment score, whether a decision has been made, the decision, and last comment provided.  
A report (in either .html, .docx, or .pdf format) can be downloaded for any selected packages.

![](images/database_view.png){width=800px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}

The third tab, “assessment criteria”, provides a detailed description of the assessment criteria used for Risk Calculation, Maintenance Metrics, Community Usage Metrics, and Testing metrics (not currently used).

Select the tab to for more information.
The fourth tab, “administrative tools”, allows administrators to add or delete users as well as change passwords for themselves or other users.  Details will be provided in the “administrative tools” vignette.
