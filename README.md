## Risk Assessment Shiny Application

The Risk Assessment App is an interactive web application serving as a front end
application for the [`riskmetric`](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric) R package. `riskmetric` is a framework to quantify risk by assessing a number of
metrics meant to evaluate development best practices, code documentation,
community engagement, and development sustainability. The app and `riskmetric`
aim to provide some context for validation within regulated industries.

Furthermore, the app extends the functionalities of `riskmetric` by allowing
the reviewer to

- analyze `riskmetric` output without the need to code in R,
- comment on the value of individual metrics,
- provide an overall assessment on the package (i.e., low, medium, or high risk)
based on the output of the evaluating metrics cohort,
- download a report with the package risk, metrics, and reviewer comments, and
- store assessments on the database for future viewing.

The app also provides user authentication. There are two roles on the app:
regular user and admin. The latter can add/delete users,
modify the packages in the database,
download an entire copy of the database, and modify the metric weights.

For further information about the app, please refer to the documentation.

### Our Approch to Validation

Validation can serve as an umbrella for various terms, and admittedly,
companies will diverge on what is the correct approach to validation. The 
validation approach we followed during the development of the app is
based on the philosophy of the white paper set forth by the
R Validation Hub: [White Paper](https://www.pharmar.org/white-paper/).

- An interactive UI platform that allows users to upload a list of packages to assess

- Sidebar panel to select a package and version number from the list of uploaded packages

- Set of panels that displays the details and metrics of the selected package

- Comment functionality that allows users to comment on individual metrics as well as provide an overall comment on the selected package

- Download report functionality to obtain either an html or a word document with the metrics displayed in the application
